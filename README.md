# SolarFlarePredition
The "Solar Flare Prediction" is a repository for Solar flare  prediction using LSTM and DLSTM with a Sliding window.
This work applies the LSTM and DLSTM networks on the sliding window (peak flux and within time) to predict the occurrence of solar flares. 

 # Keywords
Solar flare, Imbalance data, Resampling, LSTM, and Decomposition.

# Overview
The project includes the following:
Preprocessing: Smoothing, resampling sliding window, and normalization.
Prediction Solar flare: LSTM and DLSTM.

# DataSet
The dataset includes a list of solar flare events from 2003 to 2023 that were obtained  from x-ray GOES data(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560188).
